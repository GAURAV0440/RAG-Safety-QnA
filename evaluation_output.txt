Q: What are safety measures in industrial machinery?  |  Mode: baseline
Answer: the most rapidly growing areas of importance in industrial automation. PART 1 – THEORY AND BACKGROUND 7 — Safety and functional safety The purpose of safety is to protect people and the environment from accidents and risks caused by machines [1] the Machinery Directive for machines and safety com- ponents can be found in Annex I of the directive. In addition to general principles for the integration of safety this annex contains dedicated sections governing controls for machines and the requirements placed upon protective devices [2] and the severity of consequence. 6 Machine safety | Towards safe machinery: Risk assessment Globally, and almost without exception, statutory guidelines for the design and operation of machines mandate a risk assessment to identify potential hazards, minimize risks, and comply with applicable health [3]

Q: What is functional safety and why is it important in machine design?  |  Mode: baseline
Answer: must be designed with a level of integrity that is commensurate with the risks of the machine. Higher risks require higher integrity levels to ensure the performance of the safety function [1] — ABB DRIVES Technical guide No. 10 Functional safety 2 TECHNICAL GUIDE NO [2] from harm.

Q: What is functional safety and why is it important in machine design?  |  Mode: hybrid
Answer: must be designed with a level of integrity that is commensurate with the risks of the machine. Higher risks require higher integrity levels to ensure the performance of the safety function [1] injury from machine operation increases. Defining a safety function always includes two components: • required action (what must be done to reduce the risk) and • safety performance (Safety Integrity Level – SIL or Performance Level – PL) [2] from harm. Functional safety achieves this via systems that lower the probability of undesired events, thereby minimizing mishaps [3]

Answer: the injury The objective of the subsequent procedure is to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. For this purpose, Figure 5 [1] or system should be heavily inﬂ uenced by the operating characteristics of the machine.

Q: What are common hazards associated with industrial robots?  |  Mode: baseline
Answer: of hazards. Any power failure, lightning discharge, issues in equipment orientation, or potentially hazardous radiation are beyond control [1] industrial processes, which is resulting in a significant increase in productivity. Moreover, they are capable of performing various tasks in different industrial settings, which has further boosted their demand [2] the machinery, including the construction, installation, and disposal. Examples of typical hazards are illustrated below, though this is not an exhaustive list [3]
